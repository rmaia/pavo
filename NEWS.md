# pavo 2.5.0

## NEW FEATURES AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

* Add ability to compute colour volume by using alphashapes instead of convex 
  hulls. The functions `vol()`, `tcsvol()` and `voloverlap()` gain a new 
  argument `type = c("convex", "alpha")` to decide how you want to compute the
  colour volume. Please refer to the vignette `vignette("pavo-5-alphashapes", 
  package = "pavo")` for more information. As a result, the argument order
  in these 3 function has changed. Check the documentation to update your
  scripts accordingly. The function `summary.colspace()` also gains an 
  additional column that returns that colour volume computed with an alpha-shape
  of parameter alpha* in the case of `tcs` objects.

## MINOR FEATURES AND BUG FIXES

* `vismodel()` now works with spectral data that doesn't span the whole 
300-700nm range as long as the spectral sensitivity is zero for the missing 
range. This is useful if you have data covering the 390-700nm range and work 
the CIE model for example.
* `getimg()` now imports image files with uppercase extensions (e.g., JPG or 
PNG), such as those produced by some camera brands or processing software.
* Maximum quantum catches computation (`data.maxqcatches` attribute) now works
for segment "visual model" as well. As a side effect, this removes a warning
that occurred when users ran `vismodel(..., visual = "segment")`.
* `sensmodel()` now accepts the argument `sensnames`, for specifying the names
of the resulting sensitivity curves on-the-fly.
* CIE models now accept data created outside of `vismodel()`, by allowing users to 
specify the illuminant and viewer sensitivity function used when estimating XYZ values 
(via `illum` and `visual` arguments in `colspace()`).
* `bootcoldist()` is now laxer in its argument checks and accept objects that 
are neither `vismodel` or `colspace` objects. This means you can now use this 
function on quantum catches dataframe that you obtained outside of pavo, such
as the MICA toolbox.
* `summary.colspace()` now prints a more explicit error when the `by` argument
value is not a multiple of the number of rows in the colspace object (i.e., the
number of spectra)
* Added a continuous measure of hue to the output of the categorical model of Troje (1993)
* `teal` example dataset columns have been renamed to add an additional zero in
front of single digit numbers, so that column names now sort in the correct
order by default.
* Some very small negative values in the built-in visual system data have 
been corrected .
* `as.rspec()` is now more lenient for wavelength trimming when `interp = FALSE`
and now works even if the specified `lims` do not correspond to actual wl values
from the input object.

# pavo 2.4.0

## NEW FEATURES AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

* Fixed a bug introduced in version 2.3.0 that gave wrong values for S1UV and 
S1V in `summary.rspec()`.
* several `plot()` functions for colspace (`triplot()`, `tcsplot()`, 
`tetraplot()`) gain a new `gamut` argument to plot the maximum gamut for a given
visual system and illuminant. `summary.colspace()` also now returns the maximum
colour volume for a given visual system and illuminant that you can use to
compare to the realised volume by a given dataset. More information in PR #180.
* parallel processing now relies on the `future` package, which offers windows 
and high performance computing (HPC) environments support. The progress bar is
produced by the `progressr` package and can be customised as well. As a 
consequence, the `cores` argument in `getspec()`, `adjacent()` and `classify()`
has been deprecated.

## MINOR FEATURES AND BUG FIXES

* fixed a plotting bug introduced in version 2.3.0 where it was required to run
`projplot()` twice for the background grid to be displayed.
* fixed a bug in `summary.colspace()` where `NULL` was returned instead of 
`summary.data.frame()` for non-tcs colourspaces.
* fix partial matching warnings in examples and in `bootcooldist()`
* the package has a new website at `pavo.colrverse.com`
* fixed a bug in `coldist()`that prevented the calculation of achromatic contrast
when using custom quantum catch data 

# pavo 2.3.0

## NEW FEATURES AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

* `plot.rspec()` now adds a linear spectrum alongside the x-axis to show the 
hues corresponding to each wavelength (controlled by the `wl.guide` boolean 
argument).
* `cieplot()` (and therefore `plot.colspace()` for CIEXYZ model) now adds the 
background of the CIEXYZ colour space by default. This can be turned off by
switching the `ciebg` argument to `FALSE`.
* `voloverlap()` uses a different algorithm to determine volume overlaps, which 
means:
  - computation is now much more efficient
  - `voloverlap()` now works for `trispace()` objects as well
  - accordingly, first two arguments of `voloverlap()` has been renamed `colsp1`
  and `colsp2` instead of `tcsres1` and `tcsres2`
  - slow and possibly inaccurate `montecarlo` option has been deprecated

## MINOR FEATURES AND BUG FIXES

* errors during argument checks in `vismodel()` now have more explicit messages.
* all `pavo` functions (excepted `vismodel()` and `spec2rgb()`) now work with
sub-nm precision, for `rspec` objects with non-integer wavelengths.
* `summary.colspace()` no longer fails for tcs objects with only one row.
* `vismodel()` now works for monochromats as well.
* `procspec(opt = "bin")` no longer counts bin edges twice (once in each consecutive bin). This will cause changes in the bin stops compared to earlier versions of this function.
* `coc()` and `categorical()` spaces now return Weber luminance contrast by default when passed through `coldist()`, rather than nothing (as per the original publications). 
* `coldist()` can now take multiple values for `weber`, when Weber fractions are known for all receptor classes
* `summary.rspec()` no longer errors for a single spectrum when the wavelength range does not contain 450-700nm

# pavo 2.2.0

## NEW FEATURES AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

* added k-medoids clustering as an option in `classify()`
* `coldist()` now returns unweighted Euclidean distances for generic di-, tri-, and tetra-chromatic `colspace()` models. Users wishing to estimate noise-weighted distances (i.e. via the receptor-noise limited model) should continue to use `coldist()` directly on `vismodel()` objects, as previously.

## MINOR FEATURES AND BUG FIXES

* added a message to indicate what distance metric is being calculated during calls to `coldist()` 
* `vismodel()`, `colspace()`, and `coldist()` now always return `lum` and `dL` columns, for consistency
* `irrad2flux()` and `flux2irrad()` use slightly more precise constant values, which may lead to slightly different results (less than 0.1% difference between this new version and the previous versions)
* `getimg()` can now import images from URL's
* the `cores` argument in `getimg()` is deprecated, as image import is vectorised
* fixed a small bug in `classify()` when using `refID` and `kcols` for multiple images
* the `resize` argument in `procimg()` now takes a percentage, rather than scaling factor
* fixed a bug where `colspace(space = segment)` would return both a `B` and (redundant) `lum` column
* fixed a bug where the rod sensitivity of _Canis familiaris_ was inaccessible through `vismodel()`
* fixed an issue in `getspec()` where badly encoded characters in some spectral files would cause failure
* fixed a bug where `coldist()` would attempt to estimate receptor-noise weighted distances rather than cie-distances for `cielch` model results

# pavo 2.1.0

## NEW FEATURES AND POTENTIALLY BREAKING CHANGES

* added the argument `reclass` to `procimg()`, which allows users to interactively
correct areas within images that have been misclassified
* added the rod sensitivity of _Canis familiaris_
* `peakshape()` uses a completely different algorithm to find the FWHM. It now
works as expected for spectra with multiple peaks. See [PR #137](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo/pull/137) for a detailed 
overview of the changes.
* data used internally by pavo (`bgandilum`, `transmissiondata`, `ttvertex`, `vissyst`) is no longer exposed to users

## MINOR FEATURES AND BUG FIXES

* new functions `is.vismodel()` and `is.colspace()` are exported to test whether an object is of class `vismodel` or `colspace`, respectively
* fixed a bug where images would sometimes be wrongly detected as user-classified in `as.rimg()`
* the UV-sensitive cone is now only always named "u", even for VS species (such as `pfowl` and `avg.v` in `vismodel()` and `sensdata()`). This removes an unnecessary but harmless warning when `colspace()` was used to place quantum catches of such species in the tetrahedral colour space.
* the `achro` argument in `coldist()` has been changed for `achromatic` to
better match the arguments from `vismodel()`. Older scripts that use `achro` 
should not be affected and still work as before.
* the package `imager` is no longer a dependency, and is only loaded if using some 
features of `procimg()`.
* the package `mapproj` is no longer a dependency, and is only loaded if using 
`projplot()`.
* added the argument `labels.stack` to `plot.rspec`, which allows the use of 
custom spectra labels in stacked plots.
* users now receive a warning when interpolating beyond the limits of the data using `as.rspec`, and can control the behaviour with the new argument `exceed.limits`. 
* all deprecated functions and arguments have now been fully removed.
* `as.rspec()` now accepts both numeric and character vectors to identify the wavelength column using `whichwl` (eg. `whichwl = "wl"`).  
* Reference images in `classify()` can now be specified using either a numeric vector (to identify by image position in a list) or character vector (to identify by image name).  
* fixed a bug in `aggspec()` when wavelength column was previously removed by the user.
* fixed a bug where `cocplot()` would failed whenever `type` graphical parameter was specified.
* `spec2rgb()` has been simplified to rely more on `vismodel()`. As a result, output values may be slightly different but upon testing, we found that differences between the old and the new version were barely noticeable.
* the vignette have been split into three smaller parts, which should help new users to get started with pavo
* numerous under-the-hood changes for stability and speed, with thanks to 
three reviewers and an associate editor at MEE.

## MINOR FEATURES AND BUG FIXES

* Carotenoid chroma (S9) in `summary.rspec()` has been fixed to (R700 - R450)/R700.
This gives the same result as before but with a flipped sign, and better reflects
the original formula in the literature.
* cieLAB values have been rescaled, and are expressed in the more standard range:
L [0,100], ab [-128,127]

account when possible
* `as.rspec()` no longer fails with tibbles
* bin option of `procspec()` now works for all values of bins
* non-relative quantum catches from dataframe object were not correctly scaled
in "di", "tri", "categorical" and "coc" colorspaces
* fixed a bug in `colspace()` where it would incorrectly infer a preference for
a general trichromatic space, when a cie model is more appropriate
* fixed a bug so that cie color matching functions can be more easily be used in
a general trichromatic space (i.e. maxwell triangle)

# pavo 1.2.0

## MAJOR CHANGES

* added the sensdata() function for retrieving and/or visualising pavo's in-build spectral data

## MINOR FEATURES AND BUG FIXES

* vignettes have been amalgamated & the single, main vignette is now up-to-date
* added more informative labels for the segment analysis plot

# pavo 1.1.0

## NEW FUNCTIONS

* segspace() replaces the deprecated segclass(), and is accessed via the colspace() argument space = 'segment'. The results of segspace()
are also now compatible with coldist() for the estimation of Euclidean colour-distances.
* segplot() is a plot for Endler's (1990) segment analysis, and is accessed — along with all other 2d plots — via plot.colspace()

# pavo 1.0

* See vignette for detailed description of changes.

## MAJOR CHANGES

* coldist() arguments have been changed. Now the empirically estimated value for the Weber fraction must be entered, instead of the noise-to-signal ratio. The noise-to-signal ratio is then calculated based on the empirically estimated Weber fraction for the reference cone type, and applied to the remaining cone types. This should avoid confusion between empirically estimated values for the Weber fraction and the noise-to-signal ratio, which are currently prevalent in the literature.
* coldist() now has an additional argument, weber.achro, so that the value for the Weber fraction to be used to calculate achromatic contrast can be input independently of the cone ratios.
* tcs() is deprecated, replaced by colspace().

## NEW FUNCTIONS

* colspace() replaces tcs() and introduces several new colorspaces
* plot() methods for several colspace() outputs, including a static tetrahedral colorspace
* projpoints() allows the plotting of points in a projplot() figure

* summary.colspace() for tcs spaces now returns relative color volume as well as absolute
* tcsvol() and voloverlap() now allow control for line width
* procspec() fixed error when attempting to smooth rspec object without column names
* procspec() handles smoothing before fixing negatives to avoid re-adding negatives when smoothing
* procspec(), aggplot() accept additional arguments to summary functions (e.g., na.rm=TRUE)
* peakshape() default wavelength limits (lim) now taken from rspec object rather than 300-700
* peakshape() returns warning if a spectrum contains duplicate reflectance values
* summary.rspec() works with single spectra
* aggplot() and aggspec() fixed bug on ordering of levels when they don't match the sequence in the rspec object
* aggplot() added logical argument "legend" for automatically adding a legend to the plot
* vismodel() returns error if bkg=NULL
* getspec() patched to stop returning warnings in Yosemite
* getspec() has a faster (~5-10X), but less flexible, algorithm used when all input files are from the same source.
