#' Colour volume overlap
#'
#' Calculates the overlap between the volumes defined by two sets of points in cartesian
#' space.
#'
#' @importFrom geometry convhulln intersectn
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @param colsp1,colsp2 (required) data frame, possibly a result from the [colspace()]
#' function, containing
#' values for the 'x', 'y' (and possibly 'z') coordinates as columns (labeled as such)
#' @param type if "convex", the colour volume is plotted using a convex hull
#'   and if "alpha", it is plotted using alphashapes.
#' @param avalue if `type = alpha`, the alpha parameter values for `colsp1` and
#' `colsp2` respectively to compute the alphashapes. Can be a numeric of length
#' one if the same value is used in both cases. `avalue = "auto"` (default)
#' finds and use the \ifelse{html}{\out{&alpha;*}}{\eqn{$\alpha^*$}{alpha*}}
#' value as defined in Gruson (2020).
#' @param nsamp if `type = "alpha"`, the number of points to be sampled for the
#' Monte Carlo computation. Stoddard & Stevens(2011) use around 750,000 points,
#'  but more or fewer might be required depending on the
#' degree of overlap.
#' @param psize if `type = "alpha"` and `plot = TRUE`, sets the size to plot the points
#' used in the Monte Carlo computation.
#' @param plot logical. Should the volumes and points be plotted? (defaults to `FALSE`).
#' This only works for tetrahedral colourspaces at the moment.
#' @param interactive logical. If `TRUE`, uses the rgl engine for interactive plotting;
#' if `FALSE` then a static plot is generated.
#' @param col a vector of length 3 with the colours for (in order) the first volume,
#' the second volume, and the overlap.
#' @param fill logical. should the two volumes be filled in the plot? (defaults to `FALSE`)
#' @param new logical. Should a new plot window be called? If `FALSE`, volumes and their
#' overlap are plotted over the current plot (defaults to `TRUE`).
#' @param lwd if `plot = TRUE`, sets the line width for volume grids.
#' @param ... additional arguments passed to the plot. See [vol()]
#'
#' @return Calculates the overlap between the volumes defined by two set of points in
#' colourspace. The volume from the overlap is then given relative to:
#' - `vsmallest` the volume of the overlap divided by the smallest of that defined
#' by the the two input sets of colour points. Thus, if one of the volumes is entirely
#' contained within the other, this overlap will be `vsmallest = 1`.
#' - `vboth` the volume of the overlap divided by the combined volume of both
#' input sets of colour points.
#' If `type = "alpha"`, If used, the output will be different:
#' - `s_in1, s_in2` the number of sampled points that fall within each of the volumes
#' individually.
#' - `s_inboth` the number of sampled points that fall within both volumes.
#' - `s_ineither` the number of points that fall within either of the volumes.
#' - `psmallest` the proportion of points that fall within both volumes divided by the
#'  number of points that fall within the smallest volume.
#' - `pboth` the proportion of points that fall within both volumes divided by the total
#'  number of points that fall within both volumes.

#' @note Stoddard & Stevens (2011) originally obtained the volume overlap through Monte Carlo
#' simulations of points within the range of the volumes, and obtaining the frequency of
#' simulated values that fall inside the volumes defined by both sets of colour points.
#'
#' @note Stoddard & Stevens (2011) also return the value of the overlap relative to one of
#' the volumes (in that case, the host species). However, for other applications
#' this value may not be what one expects to obtain if (1) the two
#' volumes differ considerably in size, or (2) one of the volumes is entirely contained
#' within the other. For this reason, we also report the volume relative to the union of
#' the two input volumes, which may be more adequate in most cases.
